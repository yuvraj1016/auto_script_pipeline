It's so unhealthy for you, mentally and physically. It spikes your cortisol to start the day and it's just a terrible way to start. Second thing, grayscale mode for 90% of the day. Your phone is literally designed to be addicting. When you turn on grayscale mode, you% of the day. Your phone is literally designed to be addicting. When you turn on grayscale mode, you remove all of the addicting colors that attract you and make you just check during the course of the day. So turn your phone on to grayscale mode and you avoid that addiction that's pulling you away from the things that really matter. The third habit was my one, one, one journaling method. You write down one win from the day, one point of gratitude and one point of gratitude, and one point of tension, stress, or anxiety. If you do that at the end of every single day, you'll remind yourself about that win, the positive thing that you did during the day that you can feel good about."

The problem is that none of these things actually work and it's just a waste of time. They always tell you to warm up before camp, be friendly, and learn different weapons. Like what even is that. Here is the real truth, until immortal, if you have good aim, positioning and movement, you can legit blast music in your headphones without even talking to your team. And how do you get there? Be selfish, if your goal is to rank up fast, play to win. If you're really good with one agent or one role, play only that agent or role. If someone else install locks that agent, dodge. If you don't care much about ranking up, quit watching this video. If you have stupid teammates who only complain on the mic, talk trash, flame, or give bad comms mute them instantly, like I said in the other video, you don't have time for stupid drama and fixing someone's untreated childhood issues. Which brings me to the next idea. Play only when you feel like playing and when you feel good. If you don't feel like playing but want to rank up just don't play. This is just a game and think about it this way. If you play 10 games while feeling like crap, you might lose all 10. But if you feel good and only play 5, you might win 4. The next day you play 5 again and might win all 5. All that matters is the overall win rate, not how you play day by day. Next, skip deathmatch. It's just to shut off your brain, not to actually improve aim. All these people tell you to play deathmatch because it will make you a good player and more aware. Watch any pro play DM and see if they legit try it all during DM. They just zone out, shoot heads, and that's all. It's to warm up, not to actually get good at aiming or at the competitive mode. Get some cool skins. I don't know if it's just me but whenever I have cool skins I play better. Don't get me wrong I hate Riot with all my guts and wish nothing but downfall to their entire company but some of these skins are really cool. Like I said it's 90% mental. If you feel good, you play good. That's the whole idea. All these 30 minute videos fail to mention this, they just want you to buy their stupid coaching and courses. Now if you have better friends, play with them. But Kimmy, that's called boosting. Who cares? You still learn more by playing with better players, even if you bottom frag. Plus you rank up faster. Since I was playing CS 1.6, I always had better players on my team and guess what? When I went back to playing with my other friends, I was the best. I progressed 10 times faster than them. Why? Because I was forced to play better just to not drag my team down. Now here's something 99% of valorant gurus don't want to accept. It doesn't matter if you're the best aimer or have the best game awareness. If you have 60 fps you can't do anything. Equipment might be the key difference between you being the top fragger and carrying your team every match and not being able to shoot for anything. Get a 360 Hertz monitor, a Logitech or Razer mouse, a good keyboard and see how that changes your game. If you want to cut a tree, you don't use a knife. Same thing with Valorant. Now go in there, get some kills and stop listening to these cringe YouTubers making 40 minute videos about being friendly and cooperating. Arrivederci!"

        "body": "So you just finished writing some code. You commit it, you push it and then REJECTED! Of course what happened here is that someone else, let's call them John, was working on the same branch as you. You both started out at the same commit. As you wrote your code, making your local commit, John was also working on the code, making his own commit. However, John pushed his code first to the remote, for example to GitHub. So then, when you try to push your commit, it gets rejected because the remote branch is ahead of your local branch. This means that the remote branch has newer commits that your local branch doesn't have yet. But there's an easy fix. You just do a git pull to get the new changes and then pull to get the new changes and then... Actually, here is why you shouldn't do this. When you do a git pull in this situation, you're actually creating a fresh merge commit. You see, what happens is that your commit and John's commit both had the same ancestor. So by default, git pull will merge the two new commits together by creating an entirely new commit, like this. If everybody on the team does this, over time you'll just end up with a confusing commit history with a bunch of extra useless merge commits in it. This makes it really hard to navigate the commit history. For example, when you're looking for a specific commit in which a certain feature was worked on, or a bug was fixed, because then you have to sift through all those useless merge commits first. For example, when you're looking for a specific commit in which a certain feature was worked on or a bug was fixed, because then you have to sift through all those useless merge commits first. What you usually want to do instead is to just put your commit after the other person's commit. That way, the commit history will stay linear and clean. So instead of using the regular Git pull, which creates the extra merge commit, use git pull rebase. What does that do? Let's rewind first to the initial situation before we did the regular git pull. Alright, so git pull rebase will take your commit, temporarily put it to the side, do the git pull, and then it'll try to put your commit back on top. This even works if you or the other person did multiple commits. But wait, I hear you say, what about merge conflicts? What if the changes the other person made and my changes are in conflict? Normally, when you do a regular git pull you just get a merge conflict that you can then fix. When you do a git pull rebase you of course still can get merge conflicts. In that case git will tell you though then you can just undo the entire pull with a git rebase abort. This will undo everything and restore your local repo to the state it was in before you pulled. Then you can just pull normally with the regular git pull and fix the merge conflict as you usually would. So to summarize, when I work on a project I almost never use git pull, but instead I always try git pull rebase first. If it works, you're already done. If you do get a merge conflict, you can always undo the entire pull with the git rebase first. If it works, you're already done. If you do get a merge conflict, you can always undo the entire pull with the git rebase abort. Then you can just pull normally using git pull. Alternatively, you could also do an interactive rebase to fix the merge conflict, but that's a bit more involved, so let me know in the comments if you'd like to see a future video on that. In any case, you don't have to worry about breaking anything with Git pull rebase, since you can always undo it with git rebase abort if something goes wrong."

And so every single quarter, we set a goal and we put it inside of a sauna and we track wanna be people that are always progressing forward. And so every single quarter, we set a goal and we put it inside of a sauna and we track it on those bi-weekly meetings. So for example, my goal last quarter was to create an elevated wardrobe that has an elevated style that gets me compliments everywhere I go. And I was able to do that. And then my girlfriend's hers was that she wanted to create a money-making opportunity that she felt fulfilled doing and that she was generating money from by the end of the quarter. And she did that when she launched the membership site. So we both were able to add and help each other along the goals setting process, and we were holding each other accountable. The third way I treat my relationship like a business is making sure we have crystal clear communication. So what I've learned managing dozens of employees is even just one or two words wrong, and a Slack message, an email, a text message, or on a call could have disastrous implications.

And actually a few years ago, I placed over 2,000 virtual assistants for businesses online.

So whether you're doing cold email every day, you're doing cold calls every day, you're setting up ad accounts for your clients every single day, it.

The second person is gonna be a sales person. Now, a lot of people freak out about hiring a sales person, but it's really easy to do once you have an optimal selling system. So once you already are getting a certain amount of people from a certain kind of structure, whether it was a video call funnel, a cold call, an email, you have a little bit of a system behind it, you want to hire a salesperson, because although you're going to have to pay them 10% of your sales, it's going to get you back six to eight hours a day to get more appointments on your calendar to then hire more salespeople to be able to scale. And the third person should be a video editor. Now if you're not creating videos, you definitely need to in today's day and age. It's how you can build trust with your prospects before they even get on a call with you to begin with. And so editing videos is a pretty difficult thing to do. And it's funny to me, when I work with some of my clients that have millions of subscribers on YouTube, they're still editing their own videos.

The agency model has a benefit because it's super easy to sell agency services. The build and release model slash offer is beneficial because it's better for you.
